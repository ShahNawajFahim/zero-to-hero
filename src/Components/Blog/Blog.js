                <h1>What is the react router purpose?</h1>
                <p>Routing is a process in which a user is directed to different pages based on their action or request. ReactJS Router is mainly used for developing Single Page Web Applications. React Router is used to define multiple routes in the application. When a user types a specific URL into the browser, and if this URL path matches any 'route' inside the router file, the user will be redirected to that particular route.

                    React Router is a standard library system built on top of the React and used to create routing in the React application using React Router Package. It provides the synchronous URL on the browser with data that will be displayed on the web page. It maintains the standard structure and behavior of the application and mainly used for developing single page web applications.</p>

                <h1>How to work context api?</h1>
                <p>The React Context API has been around as an experimental feature for a while now, but only in React’s version 16.3.0 did it become safe to use in production. The article below will show you two basic web store apps, one built with the Context API and one without it.

                    This new API solves one major problem–prop drilling. Even if you’re not familiar with the term, if you’ve worked on a React.js app, it has probably happened to you. Prop drilling is the processing of getting data from component A to component Z by passing it through multiple layers of intermediary React components. Component will receive props indirectly and you, the React Developer will have to ensure everything works out right.</p>

                <h1>How does useRef work in React?</h1>
                <p>useRef returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument ( initialValue ). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component. Essentially, useRef is like a “box” that can hold a mutable value in its .current property.</p>
